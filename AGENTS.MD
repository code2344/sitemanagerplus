# Working Agreements for Agents

- ALWAYS implement features end-to-end (backend + UI/UX + docs/tests as applicable). Backend-only work is insufficient.
- When the user requests features (e.g., 50 functional admin features), ensure they are actually usable by admins via the UI and APIs, not just stubbed endpoints.
- Record and respect explicit user instructions. If unsure, ask minimally and then deliver complete, functional output.
